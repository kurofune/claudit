## Job 1 — File the ask where it belongs

Never write beads by hand and never call `bd create` directly.

1. **Route.** Read the open epics:
   `bd list --type epic --status open --json`. Read each candidate's
   description and file under the one whose brief owns the ask. Otherwise
   create a new epic.
2. **Size.** One bead (one `touches` set, at most ~10 acceptance lines) →
   `/create-bead`, parented under the epic from step 1. Larger →
   `/plan-to-beads`, under that epic or its new one.
3. **Every emitted bead must carry `metadata.touches`** — the repo-relative
   path list (directories keep a trailing slash) that bead is expected to
   change. `/create-bead` takes it as the `touches` key in args mode. If one
   was emitted without it, fill it before anything drains:
   `bd update <id> --metadata '{"touches":["path/"]}'`, confirmed with
   `bd show <id> --json | jq .metadata.touches`.
4. **A direct operator ask is its own approval.** File it and never add the
   `proposed` label to it. Work the lead thinks of itself is not an ask: the
   seat charter decides how it is filed. Read the `## Self-approval` section
   of `$seat/charter.md`:
   - **The section names the kind of work** → file it through the same skills
     with the `seat-approved` label and without `proposed`; it drains like an
     ask. Record why in one line,
     `bd update <id> --append-notes "seat-approved: <why>"`, where `<why>` names
     the approved kind it matches, then say the filed block below.
   - **Anything the section does not name** → file it through the same skills
     with the `proposed` label, and it goes to triage, not the operator's yes
     (the charter's `## Triage`).
   - **No `## Self-approval` section, or one whose body is only `[TODO]`** →
     the charter approves nothing: every lead-originated bead is filed
     `proposed`, exactly as before.

   Either way, add the `from:seat:lead` label to every lead-originated bead,
   self-approved or proposed. It names the seat directory, `lead`, and never
   the display name `djinn theme show` prints for this seat. An operator's
   direct ask carries no `from:seat` label: it is the operator's work, not
   the seat's.

   A review follow-up stays `proposed` whatever the charter says (Review
   follow-ups, below); the bead re-authored from it is lead-originated work
   this step governs.
5. **A drain in flight changes nothing.** File a mid-drain ask by steps 1-4,
   never under the running drain's epic unless that epic's brief owns the ask.

A one-bead ask: file it, then say where it went in one block and go to Job 2:

```say
Filed as <bead-id> under <epic title>.
```

Lead-originated work filed `seat-approved` + `from:seat:lead`: say it in one
block, the same turn, then go to Job 2:

```say
Filed on my own as <bead-id>: <why>.
```

A plan-sized ask: run `/plan-to-beads` up to its output (not Execute Mode), then
**show the operator the bead list with titles and wait for a yes before
filing.** On yes, run its Execute Mode, then go to Job 2.

```say
That is plan-sized — <n> beads under <epic title or "a new epic">:

  <title>
  <title>

Say yes and I will file them, or tell me what to change.
```

Read filed beads back with `bd list --parent <epic-id> --all --flat --json`.

### Or hand it to the planner

An ask the operator does not want to wait for or sit through goes to the planner
seat as mail instead of through steps 1-5. It qualifies on any of three
triggers: it is **large** (plan-sized, and the operator would rather not review
a bead list now), **vague** (you cannot write its acceptance lines without
guessing), or it **needs research before filing** (code, docs or DECISIONS.md
rows must be read before anyone can say what to build). When an ask needs
research before filing, offer this route by default, before researching it
yourself; for a large or vague ask, offer it when the operator signals they
would rather not wait.

```say
That needs working out before it can be filed. I can hand it to <planner display
name>: it plans this on its own and files the beads, and triage decides them
for you. Say hand it over, or say now and we file it together.
```

On a yes, write the operator's words verbatim, plus every constraint they named,
to a file and send them as one message bead — the planner's mail, not a work
bead, so it skips `/create-bead`:

```bash
bd create --type message --title "<the ask>" --label to:seat:planner --silent --description="$(cat /tmp/ask.md)"
```

`--silent` prints the message id. Say it in one block, then stop: nothing
drains until the planner has filed.

```say
Sent to <planner display name> as <message-id>. Triage decides its plan; the
digest tells you what it decided, and anything it sends to you comes back as
needs-you.
```

The planner files one epic labelled `proposed`, every bead under it labelled
`proposed` too. The epic and its beads go to triage, not to the operator's yes:
the lead's triage duty and two more judges vote, and the majority decides. Go
removes `proposed` and the plan drains; no-go declines it. One a judge flags
under a hard rule comes back to the operator as a `triage:operator` bead
(Job 4). Never remove `proposed` from them by hand.

When the operator says no to a proposed bead — a planner epic or bead, or work
the lead filed `proposed` — decline it: add the `declined` label and close the
bead with the operator's words as the reason. The label is what keeps any seat
from proposing it again; never close a proposal without it. A review follow-up
is never declined (Review follow-ups, below).

```bash
bd update <id> --add-label=declined
bd close <id> --reason "declined: <the operator's words>" --force
```


## Review follow-ups — proposals the lead re-authors

Review follow-ups are filed `proposed` and have not passed `/create-bead`. Find
them with
`bd list --label proposed --status open --desc-contains '**Location:**' --json`.
Each one becomes workable only this way:

1. Author a fresh bead through `/create-bead` (Job 1 routing and sizing) from
   the proposal's `**Finding:**` and `**Location:**` lines.
2. Close the proposal naming it:
   `bd close <proposal-id> --reason "re-authored as <new-bead-id>"`.

The re-authored bead is lead-originated work (Job 1 step 4): one the charter's
`## Self-approval` names is filed `seat-approved` and drains; one filed
`proposed` goes to triage like any seat's proposal.

Never remove `proposed` from a review follow-up: that drains it ungated.
