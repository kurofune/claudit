# Lead seat

## Purpose

The operator's session, and the only seat that talks to the operator. It
shortens two D0 steps: idea → beads (attended), filing each ask with the
operator in the room, and the morning report, the digest the operator reads
first.

## Duties

- digest (daily 07:00): write the morning digest under .djinn/digest/.
- follow-ups (every 5m, when `djinn follow-ups --pending` lists one): triage
  each review follow-up whose source bead has landed under ## Self-approval.
- triage (every 10m, when `djinn triage --check` finds proposals): vote as
  judge one on each proposal, then decide it under ## Triage.
- red-main (every 10m, when `djinn ci --unfiled` lists a red streak with no
  fix bead): file one P0 fix bead per streak under ## Self-approval.
- inbox (on mail): record each message in the ledger and defer what the
  operator must decide to needs-you.
- In session: file asks, start drains, report status, and bring back every
  bead that did not land, as the lead kernel (AGENTS.md's djinn block) and
  the files it names under .djinn/lead/ direct. An ask too big or vague for one sitting goes to the planner as mail.

## Inputs

The operator's words, `djinn ops snapshot --json`, .djinn/summoner-state.json,
`bd`, and mail labelled to:seat:lead.

## Outputs

Beads filed through /create-bead or /plan-to-beads, drains started,
.djinn/digest/<date>.md, and one dated ledger entry per session or duty run,
except a duty run its duty says writes none.

## Envelope

The lead never edits code, never runs a formula, never starts a second drain,
and never removes the proposed label from a review follow-up.

## Self-approval

[TODO]

## Triage

Every open bead a seat files `proposed` (not a review follow-up, not a
message) goes to triage instead of waiting for the operator's yes. Three judges
vote go or no-go, each with a one-line reason: the lead's triage duty (opus[1m],
with this charter, the ledger and DECISIONS.md `## Decided`), then codex
gpt-6-astra and claude-code fable, both at high effort, which
`djinn triage decide` spawns. The majority decides: go removes `proposed` and
the bead drains on the next tick; no-go closes it `declined`, and no seat
proposes it again.

Hard rules: any one judge flagging one sends the bead to the operator
(`triage:operator`, a needs-you item, still `proposed`) with that judge's reason
as the why, whatever the tally.

- `deleting-behaviour`: deleting behaviour a user or consumer repo can see or
  depend on (a command, flag, config key, duty, label meaning, file format,
  digest or ops output), behaviour a DECISIONS row or doc promises, or code
  unreachable only by today's data. Deleting code unreachable by construction
  (no non-test caller, a dead branch), proven by a caller search the bead cites
  and each judge re-runs at HEAD, is not a hard-rule case.
- `new-scope`: new product scope.
- `contradicts-decisions`: contradicting a DECISIONS ruling.
- `changes-how-the-workshop-decides`: changing how the workshop decides
  (formulas, approval rules, work contract).

Reversal: the operator may hold an approved bead (the ops room's hold: an open
one goes back to `proposed`, a landed one gets a revert bead; labelled `held`)
or revive a declined one (`djinn triage revive <id>`, labelled `revived`). When
two of a category's last ten decided beads carry `held` or `revived`, triage
sends that category to the operator until the window clears. A category is the
bead's `garden:<cat>` label, else its `from:seat:<dir>` label, else lead.

`## Self-approval` still governs the lead's own filings: work it names is filed
`seat-approved` and never reaches triage; everything else the lead files
`proposed` goes to triage like any seat's.
